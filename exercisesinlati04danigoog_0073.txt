CHAPTER XVI.

132. 1. For many reasons Caesar determined that the
war must be finished. 2. The Germans are easily induced
to cross the Rhine and come into Gaul. 3. When you
find out that we ¹have both the ability and the courage
to cross the Rhine‚ you will sear for your own posses·
sions. 4. ’Those who had crossed the river, as I have
mentioned above, were not in the battle. 5. We earnestly
beg you to send us aid, unless you are prevented by pub-
lic duties ³from doing so.

CHAPTER XVII.

133. 1. To cross the Rhine in boats is neither safe
nor 1consistent with the dignity ‘of the Roman people.
2. Therefore a bridge must be built, or else² the army
must not be taken over. 3. The loge„ sharpened a little
at the lower end, were driven in, not vertically‚ but
sloping. 4. Thess greater the violence of the water‚⁴
the⁸ more tightly are these logs held together. 5. If the
barbarians send down trees or boats tp knock down the
bridge‚ these things cannot harm it.

CHAPTER XIX.

134. 1. After the Suevi had learned that Caesar was
building a bridge, they held a council. 2. Remove from
your towns and put your wives and children „in the
woods. 3. Let all who can bear arms assemble in one
place, in about the centre1 of the country of the Suevi.
4. After² Caesar had punished the Sugambri, and relieved
the Ubii, he withdrew into Gaul. 5. He spent seventeen
days in all on the other side of the Rhine.
