with Caesar thought that, ⁸because a large quantity12 of
baggage was between the several legions of Caesar's army,
¹3the Nervii would have no trouble in attacking the first
legion 1⁴as it came into camp.

88. 1. The Nervii had ‘selected as a place for their
camp a hill wooded in the upper part, within which
woods they kept themselves secreted; and when they
saw the first ¹part of our baggage-train, 2whioh was the
time agreed upon ³for making an attack upon the cavalry,
they suddenly rushed forth from the woods ⁴in full force.

2. In the “battle with the Nervii, which ⁶took place
between the two hills where⁷ the river Sambre flows, the
Roman soldiers were much embarrassed on account of
the ⁸quick movements of the enemy. Many of ''the former
l⁰were busy fortifying the camp, and not a few were a ’

however, urged them 1²to remember their former valor,
and bravely sustain the enemy's charge.

3. The army could not be formed as the methods of
military science required, because the character of the
ground was such¹³ that the view was obstructed by
hedges, and regular¹⁴ reserves could not be posted3 nor
could Caesar alone give¹¹⁵ all the necessary orders. After
the Atrebates had been driven into the river, our men
slew with their swords a large part of them ¹⁶as they

⁶ attempted to cross.
