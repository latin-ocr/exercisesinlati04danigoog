the place ¹⁸they had started from, and some to the lower
part of the-island. The rest of the shipS, both galleys and
transportS, in which the army had been brought over,
were disabled by the storin and by the high tides. The
barbarians, seeing the Romans in such difficulties, tried
to keep them from supplies in order to prevent their
return.

GHAPTERS §nou—XXXVIII.

153. 1. Caesar suspected, from the fact that the enemy
'had stopped giving hostageS, that they were forming
¹some new plan, and would try to intercept his return
to the continent. Accordingly, since he had twelve ships
which were entirely disabled, he repaired the others with
the timber and bronze of these3 but before he could set
sail, ²while his men were engaged in foraging ³with no
suspicion of an attack, suddenly he saw from the camp
a cloud of dust in that place where the men of the
seventh legion had gone for the purpose of reaping the
gram.

2. Suspecting that the enemy were assembling to make
an attack upon the legion, he left a few cohorts to guard
the camp, and set out with all the rest of his army to
relieve that legion.

3. He soon found that a few had been already killed,
and that the rest were much alarmed by the strange
mode of fighting of the charioteers3 but as soon as he
arrived, the enemy halted, and his own troops recovered
from their alarm. After a short time he led the legions
back into camp, where for several days in succession he
was detained by storms.
