119. 1. 1By means of a suitable person, who went over
to the enemy's camp as a deserter, Sabinus confirmed the

them up and slew a large number. A new war now arose
in Aquitania, —which, as has been said, is a third part
of Gaul—whither Crassus had been sent to lead an army
against the SontiateS.

4. A long and fierce battle was fought, because⁸ the
Sontiates relied upon former victories and thought that
the safety of Aquitania lay in their valor, while⁹ the
Romans desired to show what they could accomplish

made a sortie from another part of the town, but was
