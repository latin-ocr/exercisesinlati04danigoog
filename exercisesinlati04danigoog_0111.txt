This Series will contain those portions of the Latin
authors that are usually read in American schools and
colleges3 and to meet the growing demand for more
liberal courses such other portions will be included as
are well fitted for classroom use, but which have hitherto
lacked suitable editions. In order to furnish permanent
editions of uniform merit the work is distributed among
a large number of special editom, and the several editions
will be based for the most part upon approved German
editions.

While thus profiting by t'he valuable results of German
'scholarship‚ which give the assurance of marked excel-
lence to the SerieS‚ each editor will nevertheless verify
all' the statements of the original, and add to and alter
them as much as may be necessary to adapt his work to
the needs of American studente.

The text will be carefully revised, and will be followed
in a separate part of the book by a full commentary and
index.

The Series will also contain elementary and supple-
mental-y works prepared by competent scholarS. Every
effort will bc made to give the books a neat and attrac-

tive appearance.
